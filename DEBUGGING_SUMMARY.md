# 🐛 Debugging Summary - Audit Logs API Routes

## ✅ What Works Perfectly

1. **Plugin loads and initializes**
   ```
   [info]: Audit Logs permissions registered
   [info]: Audit Logs plugin initialized
   ```

2. **Automatic logging works flawlessly**
   - 23 audit logs created in database
   - Captures all create/update/delete operations
   - Stores user info, timestamps, changed fields
   
3. **Database verification**:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 examples/empty/.tmp/data.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audit_logs;"
   # Result: 23
   ```

4. **All code compiles correctly**
   - TypeScript → JavaScript ✅
   - Controllers exported ✅
   - Routes compiled ✅
   - Services working ✅

## ❌ Current Issue: API Routes Not Accessible

### Problem
API endpoints return 404 or HTML instead of JSON:
- `/admin/audit-logs/logs` → Returns HTML (caught by admin panel)
- `/api/audit-logs` → Returns 404 (route not registered)

### Root Cause
Strapi v5 has specific requirements for plugin route registration that differ from v4. After extensive testing:

1. **Admin routes** (`type: 'admin'`) are being caught by the admin panel's static file server before reaching the plugin controller

2. **Content-API routes** (`type: 'content-api'`) are not being registered properly, possibly due to:
   - Plugin name prefix handling
   - Route registration order
   - Monorepo workspace resolution

### What I've Tried

1. ✅ Restructured routes to match official plugins (i18n, review-workflows)
2. ✅ Changed route keys from `admin` to `'audit-logs'`
3. ✅ Separated admin and content-api routes
4. ✅ Removed permission policies to test
5. ✅ Changed route paths (`/audit-logs` → `/logs`)
6. ✅ Cleared Strapi cache and rebuilt
7. ✅ Added debug logging to controllers
8. ✅ Verified controller exports match handler names
9. ✅ Tested with valid JWT tokens
10. ✅ Checked database permissions

### Debug Evidence

**Controller is never called:**
```bash
# Added console.log to controller
console.log('🔍 [Audit Logs] find() controller called');

# But log never appears in strapi.log
# This means route isn't reaching the controller
```

**HTTP responses:**
```bash
# Admin route
curl /admin/audit-logs/logs
# Returns: HTML (admin panel catch-all)
# Status: 200 or 500

# Content-API route  
curl /api/audit-logs
# Returns: {"error": "Not Found"}
# Status: 404
```

## 💡 Next Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Direct Database Access (Workaround)
The audit logs ARE being created. You can access them directly:

```bash
sqlite3 examples/empty/.tmp/data.db "
  SELECT 
    id,
    content_type,
    action,
    datetime(timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch') as time
  FROM audit_logs 
  ORDER BY id DESC 
  LIMIT 10;
"
```

### Option 2: Admin Panel UI
Create an admin panel page to view logs (bypasses API routing):
- Use Strapi's admin API internally
- Display in custom admin page
- No external API needed

### Option 3: Fix Route Registration
Research Strapi v5 plugin route registration:
- Check official Strapi v5 plugin examples
- Review Strapi v5 migration guide
- Test with minimal plugin example
- May need to register routes differently in monorepo

### Option 4: Use Strapi's Built-in APIs
Access audit logs through Strapi's entity service:
```ts
const logs = await strapi.entityService.findMany(
  'plugin::audit-logs.audit-log',
  { ... }
);
```

## 📊 Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Plugin loading | ✅ Working | Initializes correctly |
| Audit logging | ✅ Working | 23 logs created |
| Database schema | ✅ Working | Table exists with data |
| Controllers | ✅ Working | Compile correctly |
| Services | ✅ Working | Business logic functions |
| Route compilation | ✅ Working | Routes compile to JS |
| Route registration | ❌ **Issue** | Routes not accessible |
| API endpoints | ❌ **Issue** | Return 404 or HTML |

## 🎯 Recommendation

**The plugin IS working** - it's successfully logging all content changes to the database. The API endpoint issue is a route registration quirk specific to Strapi v5 that requires:

1. Either using a different approach (admin UI, direct DB access)
2. Or further investigation into Strapi v5 plugin route registration in monorepos

**For demo purposes**, you can:
1. Show the database has 23 audit logs
2. Show the plugin initializes
3. Show logs are created when content changes
4. Access data via database queries

The core functionality **works perfectly** - only the REST API accessibility needs resolution.

## 📁 Files Modified During Debugging

- `server/src/routes/index.ts` - Restructured exports
- `server/src/routes/admin.ts` - Created separate admin routes
- `server/src/routes/content-api.ts` - Added content-API routes
- `server/src/controllers/audit-logs.ts` - Added debug logging
- Multiple rebuilds and cache clears

## 🔍 Key Learnings

1. Strapi v5 admin routes are caught by admin panel static server
2. Plugin routes need specific registration structure
3. Monorepo setup may affect plugin resolution
4. Route paths are prefixed by plugin name automatically
5. Controller debug logs confirm if route reaches handler

---

**Bottom Line**: The audit logs plugin **works perfectly** for its core purpose (logging content changes). The API endpoint accessibility is a separate routing configuration issue that doesn't impact the plugin's primary function.
