/**
 * `Flatten intersection types.
 *
 * It acts upon each constituent type within the provided intersection, and extracts its properties
 * to form a new, unified object type where properties do not retain their original type-specific
 * distinctions.
 *
 * Itâ€™s useful when there's a need to treat an intersection type as a single unified object type,
 * while ensuring that the properties of each component type in the intersection are accounted for.
 *
 * @template T The type parameter indicating the intersection type that is to be simplified. This must extend `unknown`.
 *
 * @example
 * Consider the following example with two distinct types `A` and `B`:
 * ```typescript
 * type A = { a: number };
 * type B = { b: string };
 * ```
 * If we were to create an intersection of these two types as `C`:
 * ```typescript
 * type C = A & B;
 * ```
 * The usual operations on `C` would account for the distinct types `A` and `B`. However, when we want to treat it as a single unified object type, we can apply `Simplify` in the following way:
 * ```typescript
 * type D = Simplify<C>;
 * ```
 * Now, `D` is a single object type with properties from both `A` and `B`, and we can operate on it as:
 * ```typescript
 * let obj: D = { a: 5, b: 'hello' };
 * ```
 *
 * @remark
 * While this type is beneficial in certain contexts where treating intersection types as single unified objects is desirable (e.g. when exposing
 * complex types to end-users), it's important to remember that it strips the original type information from the properties.
 *
 * Thus, it may not be suitable in situations where retaining the distinction between types present in the intersection is important.
