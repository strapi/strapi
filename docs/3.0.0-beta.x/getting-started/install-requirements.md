# Installation requirements

## Node.js

Strapi only requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). The current recommended version to run strapi is `Node v10` (current `LTS`).

This is all that is needed before Strapi can run on your local environment.

You can also use **yarn** if you want, [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started) are the instructions to get started with it.

- **Node.js** >= 10.x
- **NPM** >= 6.x

## Databases

Strapi is supporting multiple databases. If you are using the `--quickstart` or if you manually choose the `SQLite` database, you will not need to install any database on you local computer.

If you want to use a custom database, here are the versions you will have to respect:

- **MongoDB** >= 3.6
- **MySQL** >= 5.6
- **MariaDB** >= 10.1
- **PostgreSQL** >= 10
- **SQLite** >= 3
