# Tutorial

This **tutorial** is written for developers to **teach and explain** a step-by-step introduction to Strapi. (The [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md) is a more concise **How-to** version.) This tutorial takes you through the beginning steps of how you start a project like **"FoodAdvisor"** ([Github](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor/))([Demo](https://foodadvisor.strapi.io/)).

You get a good overview of the features found in Strapi that developers love.

By following this tutorial, you install and create your first Strapi project.

::: tip NOTE

You need to have **_Node.js and npm_** installed on your system before following these steps. If you do not have Node.js and npm installed (or are not sure), please visit our [installation requirements](install-requirements.md).

## 1. Install Strapi and create a project

Navigate to your parent `Projects/` directory from your command line.

::: tip NOTE

In this tutorial, the example assumes a **Projects** folder on your **Desktop**. However, this is not required, and you may put your project where you want.

:::

**Path —** `~/Desktop/Projects/`

Use **only one** of the following commands to create a new Strapi project

:::: tabs

::: tab yarn

Use **yarn** to install the Strapi project (**recommended**). [Install yarn with these docs](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

```bash
yarn create strapi-app my-project --quickstart
```

:::

::: tab npx

Use **npm/npx** to install the Strapi project

```bash
npx create-strapi-app my-project --quickstart
```

:::

::::

The command creates a Strapi project `my-project/` folder within your parent `Projects/` directory.

::: tip NOTE

When you create a new Quick Start(`--quickstart`) project, Strapi downloads the node modules and the Strapi files needed. Using `--quickstart` automatically completes an **additional** step of **building the administration panel** for Strapi and then **starting** Strapi for you. This opens the browser for you and brings you to the [Welcome](http://localhost:1337/admin/plugins/users-permissions/auth/register) page.

You can replace the `my-project` name with any name you want. E.g., `yarn create strapi-app my-foodadvisor-project --quickstart` creates a folder `./Projects/my-foodadvisor-project`.

:::

You see something like this. The output below indicates that your Strapi project is being downloaded and installed.

```bash

![Strapi Registration Page](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/strapi-beta-registration-page.png 'Strapi Registration Page')

::: tip NOTE
Using the `--quickstart` flag installs Strapi using an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database. You may, at any time, leave off the **--flag**, but you need to follow a few configuration steps for your database choice. **You need to have your database choice installed and running locally before creating your project.**

If you would like to use **MongoDB** in production, you need to [install, run, and use MongoDB to develop your Strapi project (in development)](../guides/databases.md#mongodb-installation).
:::

You are now ready to create a new **Administrator** and new front-end **User**.

## 2. Create an Administrator and front-end User

The first step is to create an **Administrator** (or "root user") for your project. An **Administrator** has all administrator privileges and access rights. (You can read more about why **Administrators** and front-end **Users** are separate [here](https://blog.strapi.io/why-we-split-the-management-of-the-admin-users-and-end-users/).)

You need to complete the following fields:

- **Username**, create a username for login access to your project, e.g. `paulbocuse`.
- **Password**, create a unique password for logging into your project.
- **Email address**, this is used for recovery.
- Check **Receive news**, this is optional but **recommended**.
- Click the **Ready to Start** button.

![Completed Registration Page](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/completed-registration-page.png 'Completed Registration Page')

After your **Administrator** registration is complete, you see the Strapi _Administration Dashboard_:

![Strapi Admininstration Dashboard](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/strapi-dashboard.png 'Strapi Admin Dashboard')

**Administrators** and front-end **Users** are separate roles.

**A.** An **Administrator** has access and rights to the Administration Dashboard (or backend) of Strapi. **Administrators** can, for example, add content, add plugins, and upload images.

**B.** A front-end **User** is someone who interacts with your project through the front-end. A front-end **User** can, for example, be an "Author" of an article, make a purchase, has an account, leaves a review, or leaves a comment.

Up until this point, you have created an **Administrator**, and so you next want to create a front-end **User**.

::: tip NOTE

It is not necessary to always create a front-end **User** for your **Administrators**; in this case, the **Administrator** is also a front-end **User** as an "Author" of content in the application.

:::

- Click on `Users` located under **CONTENT TYPES** in the left-hand menu.
- Click the blue **+ Add New User** button in the top right corner.
- Next, complete the `Username`, `Email`, and `Password` fields.
- Select `ON` for the **Confirmed** toggle field.
- To the right, under **Role**, select `Authenticated`.
- Save the new user by clicking the blue **Save** button (top right).

![New front-end User](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/new-front-end-user.png 'New front-end User')

You are now ready to create your first **Content Type**.

## 3. Create a new Content Type called "Restaurant"

**Content Types** are a collection of entered data represented by fields. For example, a **Content Type** called `Restaurant` may be intended to display information regarding restaurants. A `restaurant` **Content Type** could have fields that include a `name`, the main `image`, and a `description` - _at a minimum_. However, a `restaurant` could also have a `category` or multiple `categories`, and a `restaurant` could perhaps need to show `hoursofoperation`.

A **Content Type** can be considered a sort of _blueprint_ for the data created. In other words, a **Content Type** is the schema of the data structure.

The next section guides you through the steps needed for each of these above **Content Type** fields.

::: tip NOTE

Additional **Restaurant** themed **Content Types** and fields can be seen in the [FoodAdvisor demo site](https://foodadvisor.strapi.io/).

:::

### The Restaurant Content Type

Go to the **Content Type Builder** plugin, located in the left menu: Under **PLUGINS** -> **Content Type Builder**

You are now able to see the three available **Content Types**. At this point, three Content Types are available `Permission`, `Role`, and `Users`.

![Content Type Dashboard](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/content-type-dashboard.png 'Content Type Dashboard')

You need to create a new **Content Type** for `Restaurants`.

1. Complete these steps to **Add a Restaurant Content Type**.

- Click the `+ Create new content-type` link (under existing **CONTENT TYPES**).
- Enter a **Name** for your new **Content Type** (call this `restaurant`).
- Click the `Continue` button.

![Singular Name Entries for Content Type](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/singular-name-entry.png 'Singular Name Entries or Content Type')

::: tip NOTE

The Content Type **Name** is always **singular**. For example, `restaurant` not `restaurants`.

:::

2. You are now at the **Field Selection** panel.

You may add your first field, a **Text** field for the **Restaurant** name.

![Field Section Panel](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/field-selection-panel.png 'Field Selection Panel')

- Click on the `Text` field.
- In the **Name** field, type `name`.

- Check the `Unique field` checkbox.

![Restaurant Name Advanced Settings](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurant-name-advanced-settings.png 'Restuarant Name Advanced Settings')

- Click the `+ Add another field` button.

You are now ready to add the second field, a **Rich Text** field for the **Restaurant** description.

![Field Section Panel](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/field-selection-panel-after-restaurant-name.png 'Field Selection Panel')

- Click the `Rich Text` field.

- In the **Name** field, type `description`.

![Restaurant Rich Text Field](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurant-rich-text-field.png 'Restuarant Rich Text Field')

- Click the `+ Add another field` button.

You are now ready to add the third field, a **Media** field for the **Restaurant** thumbnail image.

![Field Section Panel](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/field-selection-panel-after-restaurant-description.png 'Field Selection Panel')

- Click the `Media` field.

- In the **Name** field, type `image`.

![Restaurant Rich Image Field](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurant-image-field.png 'Restuarant Rich Image Field')

- Click on the **ADVANCED SETTINGS** tab.
- Check the `Required field` checkbox.

![Restaurant Rich Image Field Advanced Settings](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurant-image-field-advanced-settings.png 'Restuarant Rich Image Field Advanced Settings')

- Click the `Save` button.

- Wait for Strapi to restart.

![Strapi Restart](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurant-strapi-restart.png 'Strapi Restart')

After Strapi has restarted, you are ready to continue to create the `Category` **Content Type**.

## 4. Create a new Content Type called "Category"

### The Category Content Type

The `Category` **Content Type** will have a **Text** field named `category`, and a **Relation field** with a **Many to Many** relationship.

![Category Add Content Type](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/category-add-content-type.png 'Category Add Content Type')

1. Complete these steps to **add a Category Content Type**.

- Click the `+ Create new content-type` link.
- Enter a **Name** for your new **Content Type** (call this `category`).

![Category Name Field](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/category-name-field.png 'Category Name Field')

- Click the `Continue` button.

2. Now, you are ready to add fields to your **Category**.

![Category Fields](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/category-fields.png 'Category Fields')

- Click on the `Text` field.
- In the **Name** field, type `name`.

![Category Name Entry Field](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/category-name-entry-field.png 'Category Name Entry Fields')

- Click on the `ADVANCED SETTINGS` tab.
- Check the `Required field` checkbox.
- Check the `Unique field` checkbox.

![Category Advanced Settings](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/category-advanced-settings.png 'Category Advanced Settings')

You are now ready to add the second field, a **Relation** field for creating a **Many to Many** relationship between the **Category** and **Restaurant** Content Types.

- Click on the `Relation` field.

![Category Add Field Panel](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/category-add-field-panel-after-category-name.png 'Category Add Field Panel')

This brings you to the **Add New Relation** screen.

![Category New Relation Field](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/category-new-relation-field.png 'Category New Relation Field')

- Click on the _right dropdown_ with `Permission (Users-Permissions)` and change it to `Restaurant`.

![Category Relation Dropdown](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/category-relation-dropdown.png 'Category Relation Dropdown')

- Click the `Many to Many` icon (from the middle icon choices). It should now read, **"Categories has and belongs to many Restaurants"**.

![Category Relation Many to Many](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/category-relation-many-to-many.png 'Category Relation Many to Many')

- Click the `Finish` button.

![Category Save](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/category-save.png 'Category Save')

- Click the `Save` button.

- Wait for Strapi to restart.

![Category Save Strapi Restart](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/categor-create-strapi-restart.png 'Category Save Strapi Restart')

After Strapi has restarted, you are ready to create a `Component` called **"Hours of Operations"**.

## 5. Create a new Component called, "Hours of Operation"

### The Hours of Operation Component

The `Restaurant` Content Type has a **Component** field named `hours_of_operation`. This Component is **Repeatable** and for displaying the **Opening hours** and **Closing hours** of a **Restaurant**.

1. Complete these steps to **add a new Component**.

- Click the `+ Create new component` link to add a new **Component**.
- Enter a **Name** for your new **Component** (call this `hours_of_operation`).
- Select the icon of your choice.
- Create a new category for your **Component** (call it `hours`).

![Hours of Operation Add Component](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/hours-of-operation-add-compo.png 'Hours of Operation Add Component')

- Click the `continue` button.

2. Now, you are ready to add fields to your **Component**.

![Hours of Operation Add Fields](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/hours-of-operation-add-fields.png 'Hours of Operation Add Fields')

- Click on the `Text` field.
- In the **Name** field, type `day_interval`. This is to enter the **Day (or Days)** with **Hours of Operation**.

![Hours of Operation Days](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/hours-of-operation-days.png 'Hours of Operation Days')

- Click on the `ADVANCED SETTINGS` tab.
- Check the `Required field` checkbox.

![Hours of Operation Days Advanced Settings](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/hours-of-operation-days-advanced-settings.png 'Hours of Operation Days Advanced Settings')

- Click the `+ Add another field`.

You are now ready to add a second field, another **Text** field for the **Opening Hours**.

![Hours of Operation Opening Hours](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/hours-of-operation-opening-hours.png 'Hours of Operation Opening Hours')

- Click on the `Text` field.
- In the **Name** field, type `opening_hours`.

![Hours of Operation Opening Hours Name](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/hours-of-operation-opening-hours-name.png 'Hours of Operation Opening Hours Name')

- Click the `+ Add another field` button.

You are now ready to add a third field, another **Text** field for the **Closing Hours**.

![Hours of Operation Closing Hours](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/hours-of-operation-closing-hours.png 'Hours of Operation Closing Hours')

- Click on the `Text` field.
- In the **Name** field, type `closing_hours.

![Hours of Operation Closing Hours Name](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/hours-of-operation-closing-hours-name.png 'Hours of Operation Closing Hours Name')

- Click the `Finish` button.

- Click the `Save` button.
- Wait for Strapi to restart.

![Hours of Operation Strapi Restart](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/hours-of-operation-strapi-restart.png 'Hours of Operation Strapi Restart')

After Strapi has restarted, you are ready to assign this **Hours_of_operation** Component to the **Restaurant** Content Type.

::: tip NOTE

It would be possible to assign the **Hours_of_operation** Component to another **Content Type**, let's say, a **Cafe** Content Type. You have the option to reuse this component across your application.

:::

3. Next, you need to assign the **Hours_of_operation** Component to the **Restaurant** Content Type.

To access the **Hours_of_operation** Component from within the **Restaurant** Content Type, you need to **edit** the **Restaurant** Content Type in the **Content Type Builder**.

- If needed, navigate back to the **Content Type Builder**.

![Edit Restaurant Content Type](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/edit-restaurant-content-type.png 'Edit Restaurant Content Type')

- Click on the `Restaurant` Content Type, under **CONTENT TYPES**.

![Edit Restaurant Add Another Field](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/edit-restaurant-add-another-field.png 'Edit Restaurant Add Another Field')

- Click on the `+ Add another field` button to add the **Component**

![Edit Restaurant Component Field](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/edit-restaurant-group-field.png 'Edit Restaurant Component Field')

- Click on the `Component` field.
- Select `Use an existing component` option.
- Click on the `Select a component` button.

![Restaurant Component Inputs](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurant-group-inputs-use.png 'Restaurant Component Inputs')

- Ensure `hours_of_operation` is displayed in the **Select a component** dropdown.
- Provide a **name** for this component in the **Restaurant** Content Type. E.g. `restaurant_hours`
- Select the `Repeatable component` option.

![Restaurant Component Inputs](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurant-group-inputs.png 'Restaurant Component Inputs')

- Click on the `ADVANCED SETTINGS` tab.
- Check the `Required field` checkbox.

![Restaurant Component Advanced Settings](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurant-group-advanced-settings.png 'Restaurant Component Advanced Settings')

- Click the `Finish` button.

![Restaurant Component Save](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurant-group-save.png 'Restaurant Component save')

- Click the `Save` button.

- Wait for Strapi to restart.

![Restaurant Component Strapi Restart](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurant-group-strapi-restart.png 'Restaurant Component Strapi Restart')

After Strapi has restarted, you are ready to continue to the next section where you customize the user-interface of your **Restaurant** Content Type.

4. Next, you will edit the **View Settings** for the new **Hoursofoperation Component** from within the **Content Manager**.

You can _drag and drop_ fields into a different layout and _rename the labels_. This are two examples of how you can customize the user interface for your **Content Types**.

- Click on the `Configure the view`, button.

![Content Manager](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/content-manager-restaurant.png 'Content Manager')

- Click on the `Set the component's layout`.

![Content Manager Components Tab](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/content-manager-restaurant-group.png 'Content Manager Components Tab')

- Rearrange the fields and make them more user friendly. Grab the `opening_hours` and slide it next to `closing_hours`.

![Content Manager Hoursofoperation Rearrange Fields](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/content-manager-hoursofoperation-rearrange-fields.png 'Content Manager Hoursofoperation Rearrange Fields')

Next, you will change the **field labels** to make them easier to understand.

- Click on the `day_interval` field.
- Edit the **Label** to read, `Day (or Days)`.
- Add a **Description**, `You can type in one day or a series of days to complete this field. E.g. "Tuesday" or "Tues - Wed"`.

![Content Manager Hoursofoperation Day Interval](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/content-manager-hoursofoperation-day-interval.png 'Content Manager Hoursofoperation Day Interval')

- Click on the `opening_hours` field.
- Edit the **Label** to read, `Opening Hours`.

![Content Manager Hoursofoperation Opening Hours](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/content-manager-hoursofoperation-day-opening-hours.png 'Content Manager Hoursofoperation Day Opening Hours')

- Click on `closing_hours` field.
- Edit the **Label** to read, `Closing Hours`.

![Content Manager Hoursofoperation Closing Hours](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/content-manager-hoursofoperation-day-closing-hours.png 'Content Manager Hoursofoperation Day Closing Hours')

- Click the `Save` button, and then the `Confirm` button to save your settings.

Your settings have now saved.

Whenever anyone enters in information for a **Restaurant**, the entry form is cleared. With Strapi you can modify these and more settings to provide the best experience possible.

You are ready to start inputting actual content.

## 6. Manage and add content to a "Restaurant" Content Type

You are now ready to add some **Restaurants** and **Categories**.

1. You are now going to enter a new **Restaurant**.

- Navigate to and click on the `Restaurants`, under **CONTENT TYPES** in the left-hand menu.

![Restaurants Content Type](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurants-content-type.png 'Restaurants Content Type')

- Next, click on the **+ Add new Restaurant** button (in the top right corner).
- Enter in the following information for your first **Restaurant** called **Biscotte Restaurant**.
  - In the **Name** field, enter `Biscotte Restaurant`.
  - In the **Description** field, enter `Welcome to Biscotte restaurant! Restaurant Biscotte offers a cuisine based on fresh, quality products, often local, organic when possible, and always produced by passionate producers.`.
  - Upload an **Image** to represent the **Restaurant**.

**Note:** At this point, you would generally select the **Categories** for this **Restaurant**. You have not entered any **Categories**, so you do this step after entering this first **Restaurant**.

![Restaurant Content Type Basic Data](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurant-content-type-basic-data.png 'Restaurant Content Type Basic Data')

- Next scroll down to **RestaurantHours|(0)** and click the `+ ADD NEW ENTRY` button.
  - In the **Create an Entry** section, enter the following details.
    - In the **Day (or Days)** field, enter `Sun - Mon`.
    - In the **Opening Hours** field, enter `Closed`.
    - **Skip** the **Closing Hours** field, as this **Restaurant** is closed all day.
  - Click the `+ ADD NEW ENTRY` button to create another new entry.
    - In the **Day (or Days)** field, enter `Tues - Fri`.
    - In the **Opening Hours** field, enter `12:00`.
    - In the **Closing Hours** field, enter `22:30`.
  - Click the `+ ADD NEW ENTRY` button to create the last entry.
    - In the **Day (or Days)** field, enter `Sat`.
    - In the **Opening Hours** field, enter `11:30`.
    - In the **Closing Hours** field, enter `16:00`.

You have now entered in all the information necessary for your first **Restaurant**.

![Restaurants Entry](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurants-entry.png 'Restaurants Entry')

- **Scroll up** and click the `Save` button.

Next, you need to enter in some **Categories** that can relate to the above and other **Restaurants**.

- Navigate to and click on `Categories`, under **CONTENT TYPES** in the left-hand menu.

![Categories Entry](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/categories-content-type.png 'Categories Entry')

You are going to enter two **Categories**, but you could add as many **Categories** as you need. Later, you can add additional **Categories** and assign them to existing and new **Restaurants**.

- Click on the `+ Add New Category` button.
  - In the **Name** field, enter `French food`.
  - In the **Restaurants(0)** dropdown, select `Biscotte Restaurant`.

![Categories Entry 1](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/categories-entry-1.png 'Categories Entry 1')

- Click the `Save` button.

You now enter your second **Category**.

- Click on the `+ Add New Category` button.
  - In the **Name** field, enter `Brunch`.
  - In the **Restaurants(0)** dropdown, select `Biscotte Restaurant`.

![Categories Entry 2](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/categories-entry-2.png 'Categories Entry 2')

- Click the `Save` button.

You have now entered your first **Restaurant** Content Type. You have also assigned two **Categories** to this **Restaurant**. Your next step is to set the **Roles and Permissions**.

## 7. Set Roles and Permissions

By default, Strapi publishes all **Content Types** with restricted permissions. Which means you have to explicitly give permissions to each **Content Type** you create. You are going to give **Public** API (or URL) access to both the **Restaurant** Content Type and **Category** Content Type.

- Click on the `Roles & Permissions` menu item, under **PLUGINS** in the left-hand-menu.

![Roles and Permissions](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/roles-and-permissions.png 'Roles And Permissions')

- Next, click on the **Public** Role.

![Roles and Permissions Public Role](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/roles-and-permissions-public-role.png 'Roles And Permissions Public Role')

- Next, scroll down under **Permissions** and locate the **Restaurant** and **Category** Content Types.
- Click the checkbox for **find** and **findone** in the **Restaurant** Content Type.
- Click the checkbox for **find** and **findone** in the **Category** Content Type.

![Roles and Permissions Find Permissions](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/roles-and-permissions-find-permissions.png 'Roles And Permissions Find Permissions')

- Scroll back to the top, and click the **Save** button.

You have now opened the API and are ready to consume the content.

## 8. Consume the Content Type API

Each of your **Content Types** are accessible by following their automatically generated routes.

Both your **Restaurant** and **Category** Content Types can now be accessed.

- In your browser, follow `http://localhost:1337/restaurants` to return the data for the allowed **Find** value of your **Restaurant** Content Type

![Restaurant Api](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/restaurant-api.png 'Restaurant API')

- In your browser, follow `http://localhost:1337/categories` to return the data for the allowed **Find** value of your **Category** Content Type.

![Category Api](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/category-api.png 'Category API')

::: tip NOTE

If you have incorrectly (or not at all) set the permissions of your content type, you get a **"403"** permission error. See the below example.

Forbidden Access Looks like this:

![Forbidden Access to Restaurant Content Type](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/permission-forbidden-access.png 'Forbidden Access to Restaurant Content Type')
:::

::: tip NOTE

If you would like to see the route of any specific **Content Type**, you need to navigate to the **Content Type** under the **Roles and Permissions** plugin and click the ⚙️ next to the value. On the right, you see the route:

![Permission Routes](../assets/getting-started/tutorial/permission-routes.png 'Permission Routes')
