Currently, there are a few different ways to use permissions in the application. This document will explain the different ways, how to use them and suggestions
on when is best to use them. It's advised that you've read [how they work](/core/permissions/how-they-work) and [fetching permissions](/core/permissions/frontend/fetching-permissions)
before reading this document so you have the full context.

## useRBACProvider

In [fetching permissions](/core/permissions/frontend/fetching-permissions) we briefly mentioned the `useRBACProvider` hook which is used to access the [context](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
that contains the permissions. This is very low level and does nothing but give you access to _every_ permission for the user and a way to refetch them from the API.

### Usage

Because this hook is so low level, it's recommended you use one of the other hooks or the wrapper components instead which use this inside and expose the methods
of this hook.

```jsx
import { useRBACProvider } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { allPermissions, refetchPermissions } = useRBACProvider();

  const handleClick = async () => {
    await refetchPermissions();
  };

  const canSeeMyComponent = allPermissions.some(
    // this string will declared in the backend.
    (permission) => permission.action === 'plugins::my-plugin.my-component.read'
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>
        Refetch permissions
      </button>
      {canSeeMyComponent ? <p>aha you found me</p> : null}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Typescript

```ts
interface Permission {
  id: number;
  action: string;
  subject: string | null;
  // This can be custom defined to the needs of the plugin/application
  properties: Record<string, any>;
  conditions: Array<string>;
}

type UseRBACProvider = () => {
  allPermissions: Permission[];
  // This is the `refetch` method from react-query's useQueries hook
  refetchPermissions: <TPageData>(
    options?: RefetchOptions & RefetchQueryFilters<TPageData>
  ) => Promise<QueryObserverResult<unknown, unknown>>;
};
```

## Components

There are two different wrapper components available to use. They are very similar but have different use cases. They are both
available in the `@strapi/helper-plugin`.

### CheckPagePermissions

Used to apply RBAC to a view/page of the application. If the user does not have the permissions to access this page they will
be redirect to the homepage.

#### Usage

```tsx
import { CheckPagePermissions } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

const permissions = [{ action: 'plugins::my-plugin.access', subject: null }];

const MyPage = () => {
  return (
    <CheckPagePermissions permissions={permissions}>
      <h1>aha you found me</h1>
    </CheckPagePermissions>
  );
};
```

#### Typescript

```ts
interface Permission {
  id: number;
  action: string;
  subject: string | null;
  // This can be custom defined to the needs of the plugin/application
  properties: Record<string, any>;
  conditions: Array<string>;
}

type CheckPagePermissionsProps = {
  permissions: Permission[];
  children: React.ReactNode;
};

type CheckPagePermissions = (props: CheckPagePermissionsProps) => JSX.Element;
```

### CheckPermissions

Used to apply RBAC to a specific component. If the user does not have the permissions to access this component it will not be rendered.
This would be useful in the content-manager when you're trying to hide fields based on permissions.

#### Usage

```tsx
import { CheckPermissions } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

const permissions = [{ action: 'plugins::my-plugin.access', subject: null }];

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <CheckPermissions permissions={permissions}>
      <h1>aha you found me</h1>
    </CheckPermissions>
  );
};
```

#### Typescript

```ts
interface Permission {
  id: number;
  action: string;
  subject: string | null;
  // This can be custom defined to the needs of the plugin/application
  properties: Record<string, any>;
  conditions: Array<string>;
}

type CheckPermissionsProps = {
  permissions: Permission[];
  children: React.ReactNode;
};

type CheckPermissions = (props: CheckPermissionsProps) => JSX.Element;
```

## useRBAC

Is a wrapper around the [`hasPermissions`](#haspermissions) function which calls the `/admin/permissions/check` endpoint with a provided
list of permissions to assertain if a user can do a specific action. This hook is typically used with plugin permissions alongside the
global permissions object generated from the [`useRBACProvider`](#userbacprovider) hook which can either be passed or will be accessed internally.

Because it's fetching, we also provide a `isLoading` state which can be used to show a loading state while the permissions are being fetched.
If the hook is unmouted before the fetch request completes, the request will be cancelled via an [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController).

### Usage

In the below example, we're checking if a user can "create" a post from the content-manager list view. If they can't, the button is `disabled`.

```tsx
import { useRBAC } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { isLoading, allowedActions } = useRBAC({
    create: [
      {
        action: 'plugin::content-manager.explorer.create',
        subject: 'api::post.post',
      },
    ],
  });

  if (isLoading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  }

  return <button disabled={!allowedActions.canCreate}>create entry</button>;
};
```

### Typescript

```ts
interface Permission {
  id: number;
  action: string;
  subject: string | null;
  // This can be custom defined to the needs of the plugin/application
  properties: Record<string, any>;
  conditions: Array<string>;
}

interface PluginPermissions {
  create: Permission[];
  read: Permission[];
  update: Permission[];
  delete: Permission[];
  publish: Permission[];
}

type UseRBAC = (
  pluginPermissions: PluginPermissions,
  permissions?: Permission[]
) => {
  isLoading: boolean;
  setIsLoading: () => void;
  allowedActions: {
    canCreate: boolean;
    canRead: boolean;
    canUpdate: boolean;
    canDelete: boolean;
    canPublish: boolean;
  };
};
```

## useSyncRBAC

:::note
This hook is only available in the content-manager.
:::

This hook because it's only used in the content-manager, has specific redux dependencies on the injected reducers for the content-manager.
It sets / resets and provides the permissions based on the specific view of the content-manager you're in e.g. the listView (known as the explorer)
in conjunction with the content-type you're viewing e.g. `api::post.post`.

### Usage

In the below example, we use the hook to only get the permissions for the `api::post.post` content-type.

:::caution
While it is required to pass three arguments, only the middle argument is currently used.
:::

```tsx
import { useQueryParams } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';
import { useSyncRBAC } from 'path/to/conent-manager/hooks';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [{ query }] = useQueryParams();

  const permissions = useSyncRBAC(query, 'api::post.post', 'explorer');

  return !permissions ? (
    <p>Loading...</p>
  ) : (
    <CheckPagePermissions permissions={permissions}>
      <h1>aha you found me</h1>
    </CheckPagePermissions>
  );
};
```

### Typescript

```ts
interface Permission {
  id: number;
  action: string;
  subject: string | null;
  // This can be custom defined to the needs of the plugin/application
  properties: Record<string, any>;
  conditions: Array<string>;
}

type UseSyncRBAC = (
  query: Record<string, string> | undefined,
  contentTypeUID: string,
  viewId?: string
) => Permission[];
```
