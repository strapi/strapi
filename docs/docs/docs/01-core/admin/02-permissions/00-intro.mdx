# Permissions (RBAC)

:::caution
This is not about the `user-permissions` plugin which is API orientated, this is about roles based access control commonly known as RBAC.
:::

This section is an overview of all the features related to the Permissions core plugin:

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
