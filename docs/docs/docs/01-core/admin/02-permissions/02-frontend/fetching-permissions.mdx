This document lays out the code-flow of fetching the permissions in the CMS and how the data is then injected in to the app
to be used by components.

## Where do we fetch them?

At the very root of the entire admin panel we handle 4 routes:

- Signing into the app
- Not Found
- Collecting information from a first time user
- The authenticated application (where you use the CMS)

Permissions, along with other vital application information is fetched in in the `AuthenticatedApp` component, located
in the `packages/core/admin/admin/src/AuthenticatedApp` folder. The cache key (used with `react-query`'s `useQueries` hook)
for the particular call is `admin-users-permission`.

## What do we fetch?

Because permissions are based on users in this case the individual logged in, we fetch their permissions from the route:
`/admin/users/me/permissions`. An example can be seen below:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 426,
      "action": "admin::api-tokens.access",
      "subject": null,
      "properties": {},
      "conditions": []
    },
    {
      "id": 427,
      "action": "admin::api-tokens.regenerate",
      "subject": null,
      "properties": {},
      "conditions": []
    },
    {
      "id": 763,
      "action": "plugin::content-manager.explorer.create",
      "subject": "api::homepage.homepage",
      "properties": {
        "fields": ["title", "slug", "single", "multiple"],
        "locales": ["en", "fr"]
      },
      "conditions": []
    },
    {
      "id": 765,
      "action": "plugin::content-manager.explorer.read",
      "subject": "api::homepage.homepage",
      "properties": {
        "fields": ["title", "slug", "single", "multiple"],
        "locales": ["en", "fr"]
      },
      "conditions": []
    },
    {
      "id": 767,
      "action": "plugin::content-manager.explorer.update",
      "subject": "api::homepage.homepage",
      "properties": {
        "fields": ["title", "slug", "single", "multiple"],
        "locales": ["en", "fr"]
      },
      "conditions": []
    }
  ]
}
```

An explanation on how these work can be found [here](../01-how-they-work.mdx). But as a quick overview we can see that permissions
typically associate to actions and in the case of the content manager they have subjects to be more granular and then fields & locales to
be even more granular. These actions are defined by domains of the application registered via the application as they also have effect
when calling APIs.

## What do we do with the data?

The data is then passed to the `RBACProvider` component which passes it to a public facing [React Context](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
as well as injecting the information into the global `redux` store â€“ see diagram below:

Inside the `RBACProviderContext` we also pass the ability to refetch the permissions. These two inconjunction with one another are accessed
via the `useRBACProvider` hook. You can see the API for this hook [here](../../02-permissions/02-frontend/using-permissions.mdx#typescript)
