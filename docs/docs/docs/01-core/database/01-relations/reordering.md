Strapi allows you to reorder a relation list.

This reordering feature is available in the Content Manager and the API.

## Code location

`packages/core/database/lib/entity-manager/relations-orderer.js`

## How is the order stored in DB?

- We store the order value of the relation in an `order` field.
- For bidirectional relations, we store the order value of the other side in an `inverse_order` field.

We store order values for all type of relations, except for:

- Polymorphic relations (too complicated to implement).
- One to one relations (as there is only one relation per pair)

### Many to many (Addresses &lt;-&gt; Categories)

<img src="/img/database/m2m-example.png" alt="many to many relation" />

- `category_order` is the order value of the categories relations in an address entity.
- `address_order` is the order value of the addresses relations in a category entity.

### One to one (Kitchensinks &lt;-&gt; Tags)

<img src="/img/database/o2o-example.png" alt="one to one relation" />

- there is no `order` fields as there is only one relation per pair.

### One way relation (Restaurants &lt;-&gt; Categories)

Where a restaurant has many categories:

- `category_order` is the order value of the categories relations in a restaurant entity.
- There is no `restaurant_order` as it is a one way relation.

## How to reorder relations in the DB layer

See more on [Strapi Docs](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest/relations#connect)

The database layer should receive a payload shown below:

```js
  category: {
    connect: [
      { id: 6, position: { after: 1} },    // It should be after relation id=1
      { id: 8, position: { end: true }},   // It should be at the end
    ],
    disconnect: [
      { id: 4 }
    ]
  }
```

## How does relations reordering work?

We use fractional indexing. This means that we use decimal numbers to order the relations. See the following diagrams below for a more detailed understanding.

### Algorithm steps

From the `connect` array:

- For every element, **load relations by id**, **from fields `after` or `before`**.
- Start computing based on the `after` and `before` relations:
  - **Initialize** with after/before relations (**step 1**). Let's call these ones **init relations.**
  - **Apply the updates** from the `connect` array, **sequentially**.
    - If the update is of type `before`:
      - Place the element with the given `id` **before** the specified element in the list.
      - If the specified element is an `init relation`, place the element in between that relation and the one before it.
        - To determine the order value, **order = beforeRelation.order - 0.5**. This ensures the element is placed before the `before` relation and after the one before it.
      - Else **order = beforeRelation.order**
    - If the update is of type `after`:
      - Place the element with the given `id` **after** the specified element in the list.
      - If the specified element is an `init relation`, place the element in between that relation and the one after it.
        - To determine the order value, **order = beforeRelation.order + 0.5**. This ensures the element is placed before the `after` relation and before the one after it.
      - Else **order = beforeRelation.order**
    - If the update is of type `end`:
      - Place at the **end**
        - If placing after an init relation: **order = lastRelation.order + 0.5**
        - Else **order = lastRelation.order**
    - If the update is of type `start`:
      -Place at the **start**
      - **order = 0.5**
    - `before/after`: If the **id does not exist in the current array**, **throw an error**
    - If an **id** was **already in this array, remove the previous one**
- **Grouping by the order value**, and ignoring init relations
  - Recalculate order values for each group, so there are no repeated numbers & they keep the same order.
    - Example : `[ {id: 5 , order: 1.5}, {id: 3, order: 1.5 } ]` â†’ `[ {id: 5 , order: 1.33}, {id: 3, order: 1.66 } ]`
  - **Insert values in the database**
  - **Update database order based on their order position.** (using ROW_NUMBER() clause)

From the disconnect array:

- Delete the relations from the database.
- Reorder the remaining elements in the database based on their position, using ROW_NUMBER() clause.
