# Configuring pack-up

By default, `pack-up` is designed to use the `package.json` as a source of truth to bundle your package.
This creates a seemless alignment between the bundling & publishing process. However, if you require more
flexibility, `pack-up` also supports a configuration file – `packup.config.[mtj]s`.

## Usage

```ts
// package.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@strapi/pack-up';

export default defineConfig({
  minify: true,
  sourcemap: false,
  externals: ['path', 'fs'],
});
```

## Interface

```ts
interface Config {
  /**
   * An array of entry points to bundle. This is useful if you want to bundle something that should not
   * be exported by the package, e.g. CLI scripts or Node.js workers.
   */
  bundles?: ConfigBundle[];
  /**
   * The directory to output the bundle to.
   */
  dist?: string;
  /**
   * A list of external dependencies to exclude from the bundle.
   * We already collect the dependencies & peerDeps from the package.json.
   */
  externals?: string[];
  /**
   * Whether to minify the output or not.
   */
  minify?: boolean;
  /**
   * Whether to generate sourcemaps for the output or not.
   */
  sourcemap?: boolean;
  /**
   * The transpilation target of the bundle. This is useful if you're bundling many different CLIs or
   * Node.js workers and you want them to be transpiled for the node environment.
   */
  runtime?: Runtime;
}

interface ConfigBundle {
  source: string;
  import?: string;
  require?: string;
  runtime?: Runtime;
}

type Runtime = '*' | 'node' | 'web';
```
