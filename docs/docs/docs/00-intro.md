Hello & welcome to the contributor documentation of the Strapi Monorepo! Here you'll find both technical and conceptual documentation on the codebase.

Generally speaking the documentation structure is as follows:

```shell
core/
├─ admin/
├─ content-manager/
│  ├─ documentation-file.mdx
├─ content-type-builder/
plugins/
├─ documentation/
├─ i18n/
```

This helps keep the documentation organized according to the file structure of the `packages` folder within the monorepo. From there however, is dependant on the documentation written, it will most likely change over time when the documentation grows and develops.
