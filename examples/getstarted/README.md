# getstarted

This is an example app you can run to test your changes quickly.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker compose
- Node

## Installation

By default once you have setup the monorepo you will be able to run the getstarted app with a sqlite DB directly.

If you wish to run the getstarted app with another database you can use the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file at the root of the directory.

### start the databases

Run the following command at the root of the monorepo

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

If you need to stop the running databases you can stop them with the following command:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml stop
```

### run the getstarted app with a specific database

```
DB={dbName} yarn develop
```

The way it works is that the `getstarted` app has a specific `database.js` config file that will use the `DB` environment variable to setup the right database connection. You can look at the code [here](./config/environments/development/database.js)

**Warning**

You might have some errors while connecting to the databases.
They might be coming from a conflict between a locally running database instance and the docker instance. To avoid the errors either shutdown your local database instance or change the ports in the `./config/environments/development/database.js` and the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file.

**Example**:

`database.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  connections: {
    default: {
      connector: 'mongoose',
      settings: {
        // host: 'localhost',
        // database: 'strapi',
        // username: 'root',
        // password: 'strapi',
        port: 27099,
      },
      options: {},
    },
  },
};
```

`docker-compose.dev.yml`

```yml
services:
  mongo:
    # image: mongo
    # restart: always
    # environment:
    #   MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
    #   MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: strapi
    # volumes:
    #   - mongodata:/data/db
    ports:
      - '27099:27017'
```
