            👋 Hello, and thank you for helping us to make Strapi better!

            As part of our effort to keep the issue tracker focused and manageable, we are reviewing older reports.  
            This issue has been inactive for a while. To ensure we spend our limited resources effectively, we are prioritizing:
            - Active issues related to Strapi v5
            - Issues with recent engagement
            - Issues that are not duplicates of others

            This issue will be automatically closed in **14 days** unless there is new activity.  
            👉 If this is still relevant:
            - Please add a comment with any updates.
            - If the problem also exists in **Strapi v5**, we encourage you to open (or link to) a v5 issue.

            Thank you for helping us improve Strapi! 🙏
