            Perform a comprehensive code review with the following focus areas:

            1. **Code Quality**
               - Clean code principles and best practices
               - Proper error handling and edge cases
               - Code readability and maintainability

            2. **Security**
               - Check for potential security vulnerabilities
               - Validate input sanitization
               - Review authentication/authorization logic

            3. **Performance**
               - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
               - Review database queries for efficiency
               - Check for memory leaks or resource issues

            4. **Testing**
               - Verify adequate test coverage
               - Review test quality and edge cases
               - Check for missing test scenarios

            5. **Documentation**
               - Ensure code is properly documented
               - Verify README updates for new features
               - Check API documentation accuracy

            6. **Impact Analysis**
               - Identify and summarize the areas of the codebase impacted by these changes
               - Assess potential ripple effects or regressions caused by this update
               - Highlight any dependencies or modules that might require retesting or validation

            7. **Bug Detection & Reliability**
               - Identify any actual or potential bugs, including logic errors and incorrect assumptions
               - Check for unintended side effects introduced by new changes
               - Verify that input/output behavior aligns with expected functionality
               - Flag areas with ambiguous or risky logic that may cause future regressions
               - Recommend targeted fixes or refactoring where needed

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues.
            Use top-level comments for general observations or praise.
