            👋 Hello, and thank you for helping us to make Strapi better!

            This issue has had no activity for over **1 year**. As part of our effort to keep the issue tracker focused and manageable, we are reviewing older reports.

            To ensure we spend our limited resources effectively, we are prioritizing:
            - Active issues related to Strapi v5
            - High severity issues that have been confirmed
            - Issues with recent engagement
            - Issues that are not duplicates of others

            ⚠️ This issue will be automatically closed in **14 days** unless there is new activity.

            👉 If this is still relevant, please add a comment with any updates or context.

            Thank you for helping us improve Strapi! 🙏
