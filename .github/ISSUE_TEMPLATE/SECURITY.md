# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As of November 2019 (and until this document is updated), only the v3.0.0-beta tags of Strapi are supported for updates. Any previous versions are currently not supported and users are advised to use them "at their own risk".

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to
**[security@strapi.io](mailto:security@strapi.io)** or via the [Strapi Slack](https://slack.strapi.io).

When reporting a (suspected) security vulnerability via slack please reach out to any of the following Strapi employees directly:

- `@aureliengeorget`
- `@alexandre`
- `@lauriejim`
- `@soupette`

You will receive a response from us within 72 hours. If the issue is confirmed,
we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity
but historically within a few days.
